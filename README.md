## üë©‚ÄçüíªResearch Experience    

**Graduate Research Assistant II**   @Hong Kong University School of Public Health _(Feb 2021-Present)_    
Department of epidemiology and biostatistics.    
* Responsible for cleaning and conceptualizing large database. A piece of work can [see](https://github.com/hereagain-Y/AMR_project) here.    
* Explore the resistance pattern among different sources of samples, analyze the inter-connection base on a One Health perspective. Used generalised linear mixed effects models(GLMM) with poisson distribution to test whether antibiogram length different between different groups.   
* **_Technologies used:_** R, Linux, Python.     
   
**Data Analyst**          @Fudan University Zhongshan Hospital _(July 2020- Dec 2021)_    
* Detected the prognostic factors of Covid-19 progression and in-hospital death, later constructed a prediction nomogram on patients' outcome, and revised the paper.  
* Evaluated the impact of COPD on immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy in patients with advanced lung cancer, this paper can be accessed [here](https://tlcr.amegroups.com/article/view/51988).  
* **_Technologies used:_** R, SAS.  

**Undergraduate thesis project**      @Huazhong Agricultural University              
High-throughput data mining   
* Completed RNA-seq analysis of sweet orange transcritome, focused on uncovering genetic mechanisms in sweet orange's peel color through the utilization of bioinformatics tools.    
* Performed a cluster analysis for 25334 genes, and carried out the subsequent metabolic pathways differentially expressed Enrichment Analysis.     
* **_Technologies used:_** R, Python, Linux.
