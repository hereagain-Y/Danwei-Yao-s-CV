## üë©‚ÄçüíªResearch Experience  

**Student Data Analyst (part-time)**  @Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health _(Oct 2021-Present)_  
Key Populations Investment Fund (KPIF) at the Center of Public Health and Human Rights.  

**Graduate Research Assistant II**   @Hong Kong University School of Public Health _(Feb 2021-Present)_    
Department of epidemiology and biostatistics.    
* Develop and manage essential database processes including data cleaning and quality control.¬†A piece of work can [see](https://github.com/hereagain-Y/AMR_project) here.    
* Explore the resistance pattern among different sources of samples, analyze the inter-connection base on a One Health perspective.   
* Key contribution:¬†Used generalised linear mixed effects models(GLMM) with poisson distribution to study the antibiogram length in Escherichia coli isolates and determine the diet related risk factors for sharing the antimicrobial resistance between human and environment.  
* **_Technologies used:_** R, Linux, Python.     
   
**Data Analyst**          @Fudan University Zhongshan Hospital _(July 2020- Dec 2021)_    
* Detected risk factors associated with Covid-19 clinical deterioration and death, constructed a prediction model in terms of nomogram for clinical outcome to illustrate the probability.  
* Independently analyzed clinical data from 156 patients with advanced-stage lung cancer, applied cox hazard model to evaluate simultaneously the effect of COPD on patients'survival outcome. this paper can be accessed [here](https://tlcr.amegroups.com/article/view/51988/html).  
* **_Technologies used:_** R, SAS.  

**Undergraduate thesis project**      @Huazhong Agricultural University              
High-throughput data mining   
* Completed RNA-seq analysis of sweet orange transcritome, focused on uncovering genetic mechanisms in sweet orange's peel color and discovering pigment related genes through the utilization of bioinformatics tools.    
* Performed a cluster analysis for 25334 genes, and carried out the subsequent metabolic pathways differentially expressed Enrichment Analysis.     
* **_Technologies used:_** R, Python, Linux.
